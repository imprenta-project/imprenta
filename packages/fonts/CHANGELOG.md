### Minor Changes

- [#3](https://github.com/imprenta-project/imprenta/pull/3) [`d85bc05`](https://github.com/imprenta-project/imprenta/commit/d85bc050b45f0c9a4adb0ebbae200a8b2b944b0a) Thanks [@AbianS](https://github.com/AbianS)! - One engine that runs everywhere, instead of ten binaries that run somewhere

  Both engines are now a single WebAssembly module each, and the native addons
  are gone. What went with them: ten per-platform npm packages, a five-way build
  matrix, three hundred lines of publish workflow, and the reason all of it
  existed — a `.node` has to be linked on a machine that can produce that target.

  The modules **import nothing at all**. No Node-API, no WASI, no glue layer for
  a host to provide, which is what lets one file run in Node, the browser, Deno,
  Bun, on an edge worker, and on every platform the matrix never covered: musl,
  which is to say Alpine, which is to say a great many Docker images. A test
  asserts the import list is empty against the built module, because that
  property is the whole argument and nothing about a future change would make its
  loss obvious.

  `render`, `renderToFile`, `Printer`, `write`, `writeToFile` and `Book` keep the
  signatures they had — every one of them still returns a promise and still runs
  off the calling thread, now on a worker rather than on libuv's pool. Two things
  did change:

  - **The bytes come back as a `Uint8Array`, not a `Buffer`.** `Buffer` is Node's
    and the same module runs in a browser. A `Buffer` _is_ a `Uint8Array`, so
    `Buffer.from(pdf)` gets the string helpers back at no cost.
  - **`Engine` and `Writer` are new**, exported from `@imprentajs/pdf/engine` and
    `@imprentajs/xlsx/writer`. They are synchronous and block the calling thread,
    which is right in a worker, a CLI or a browser and wrong on a server — where
    the promise-returning calls already do the right thing.

  Alongside it, table rows are measured across every core rather than one at a
  time, which takes a 2,113-page ledger from 1,385 ms to 635 ms where threads are
  available. Measuring in batches also cut what the engine holds while it works,
  from 331 MB to 176 MB on the same document.

  **And it is faster than the addon was.** A WebAssembly module has no threads,
  so one engine renders on one core — 2.8 s on that ledger. The pool gets the
  cores back, and for a long document it does it by splitting the document
  itself: measure everywhere at once, pack once to find where the pages fall,
  paint the ranges at once, merge. **500 ms against the addon's 696**, with the
  same page count and the same numbering, because every piece is told which page
  it starts on before a glyph is placed. Nothing is renumbered afterwards, which
  is the approach this engine exists to replace.

### Patch Changes

- [`3906dda`](https://github.com/imprenta-project/imprenta/commit/3906ddacbb16379f720642962021b5bd4d19b55f) Thanks [@AbianS](https://github.com/AbianS)! - Every package now says it is public, and carries a readme.

  `0.1.0-alpha.0` went out restricted: `access: "public"` in the changesets
  config was not enough on its own, and a scoped package defaults to private, so
  the five were installable by nobody but their owner. Each declares
  `publishConfig.access` now, which is the setting npm actually reads.

  They also had no readme of their own, so their npm pages were blank — the one
  place somebody decides whether to install a thing.

## 0.1.0-alpha.0

### Minor Changes

- [`9812c67`](https://github.com/imprenta-project/imprenta/commit/9812c67aaf3719fb748872b34ee0e72e71129310) Thanks [@AbianS](https://github.com/AbianS)! - The first published version, and it is an alpha on purpose.

  A document engine in Rust, authored in React. `@imprentajs/pdf` measures and
  paginates a page and places every glyph on it; `@imprentajs/xlsx` writes a
  workbook where a number stays a number, so `SUM` returns what it should;
  `@imprentajs/react` declares either of them from components, with a separate set
  of elements per format because a page and a sheet are not the same model;
  `@imprentajs/fonts` fetches and caches Google faces without needing a CLI or a
  config file; and `@imprentajs/cli` gives you `init`, a live preview that shows the
  real PDF rather than a rendering of it, a `build` that compiles documents the
  same way the preview does, and nine rules that say whether a document will
  survive being printed.

  Installed with `@next`, because the shape of the API is not settled and a
  release that nobody can accidentally depend on is the point of this one.
